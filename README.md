Design an Android math game app using Jetpack Compose that presents the user with a series of addition problems involving numbers between 1 and 10. The app should:



Display: Show the current addition problem (e.g., "5 + 3").

Input: Provide a text field for the user to enter their answer.

Evaluation: Check if the user's answer is correct.

Turns: Allow the user a set number of turns (e.g., 3).

Game Over: Indicate when the game is over and offer a way to restart.
